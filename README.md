# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

In this project, I've blended React with Tailwind CSS for the interface, used Material-UI tables for data display, and Recharts for charts. The UI design is referenced by youtube tutorial videos.
